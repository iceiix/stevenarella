I blame Xor
Its not a bug its a feature!
Don't go to #think, tis a silly place

ThinkBot: .... *Thinkofname damn it
Now with more bugs!
I blame Mojang
The logo is totally not ascii art rendered as textures
Look, it works on my machine.
Originally in Go! https://github.com/thinkofname/steven
Open Source! https://github.com/thinkofname/steven-rust
Built with Rust!
try { } catch (Throwable e) { }
panic(recover())
try!().map_err(|e| -> ! panic!()))
fn who<'even>(uses: &lifetimes) -> anyway
inline infix fun <A, B> A.exec(f: (A) -> B): B = f(this) // simple!
if(false) true else do try return throw new this.E catch { case _ => } while(true)
// Abandon hope all ye who enter here
It's like I'm racing vanilla to see who can have the most bugs!
It's like I'm racing scala to see who has the slowest compile time!
Using ascii art for the logo seemed like a bad idea at first...
... and still does.
Help! I'm trapped in the splash text!
