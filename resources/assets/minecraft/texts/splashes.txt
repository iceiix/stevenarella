I blame Mojang
The logo is totally not ascii art rendered as textures
Look, it works on my machine.
Originally in Go! https://github.com/thinkofname/steven-go
Open Source! http://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella
Built with Rust!
try { } catch (Throwable e) { }
panic(recover())
try!().map_err(|e| -> ! panic!()))
fn who<'even>(uses: &lifetimes) -> anyway
inline infix fun <A, B> A.exec(f: (A) -> B): B = f(this) // simple!
if(false) true else do try return throw new this.E catch { case _ => } while(true)
// Abandon hope all ye who enter here
It's like I'm racing vanilla to see who can have the most bugs!
It's like I'm racing scala to see who has the slowest compile time!
Using ascii art for the logo seemed like a bad idea at first...
... and still does.
Help! I'm trapped in the splash text!
